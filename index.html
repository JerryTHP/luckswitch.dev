<h3>No-Name Video-Games</h3>
<p>In the great history of video games (as of 2026, being 68 years of glory) there have been hundreds of beloved games. More interesting than such mainstream masterpieces, are the ones that will perhaps reside in perpetual obscurity.</p>
<p>These are games either once-loved that have long since been forgotten, games that will one day be treasured, but for now lack recognition, and games that never had nor ever will have any level of mass appreciation. Where better to showcase these then an equally (nay, MORE) obscure website by a person whose opinion holds no weight?</p>
<p>These games are branches from the revered main-stream, branches either yet to grow or long since cut-off. Nonetheless, they offer a somewhat different form of play that is very amusing to the bored. Hopefully you will enjoy them too. If not, you have remarkably poor taste.</p>

<p>Ofc you can pirate afterplace but I highly reccomend supporting the dev, besides it is only 15 dollars and goes on sale constantly! <br> that's the list for now, but if the world keeps making cool games, and the world keep refusing to love them, they will be adopted here! =D</p>
