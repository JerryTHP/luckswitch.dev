<h1>MY WEBSITE</h1>
<p>I have no clue what I am doing <br> I just kinda wanted to put my own website in my bio :P <br> also probably going to OD on caffine while making this, if you notice the website stops getting updates, just assume I'm dead</p>
  
<p>for anyone asking for support on discord</p>

<!-- <h3>Hiddden gems</h3> --> <!-- ADD THIS BACK LATER, I JUST NEED TO PLAY ZORK AND NETHACK FIRST OR REMOVE THEM, AND ALSO MAKE SURE TO ADD OTHER HIDDEN GEMS -->
<!-- yes cade I removed like half the stuff you added to my website, too bad! -->

<p>Ofc you can pirate afterplace but I highly reccomend supporting the dev, besides it is only 15 dollars and goes on sale constantly! <br> that's the list for now, but if the world keeps making cool games, and the world keep refusing to love them, they will be adopted here! =D</p> -->
